   DOJI — the copies that have to agree
   ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   Four runtimes, no build step, and two facts that consequently live in more
   than one file: the setups vocabulary, and the four journal column names.

   Copies are not the problem. Copies NOTHING CAN COMPARE are, and that is what
   this closes. Every one of these values was already tested — and every one of
   those tests asserted against a literal typed into the test file beside it, so
   an editor changing a list and its own test in one pass left the other copy
   untouched and the suite green.

   Nothing here needs a build step or a running database. The app is read off
   disk by the same harness the render tests use, the function exports import
   directly, and the constraint is a line of text in a file.

   WHAT THIS CANNOT SEE: the live database. trades_setup_check is asserted as
   001_trades.sql declares it, not as Postgres holds it, so a constraint edited
   by hand in the SQL editor would pass here. supabase/verify.sql is where that
   is caught, and it is a query a person runs rather than something a suite can
   reach.
